# AbsoluteUnitsXL

A set of EXTRA-LARGE, detailed unit sprites for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).
Forked from [letstalkaboutdune's](https://github.com/letstalkaboutdune) amazing [AbsoluteUnitsXL](https://github.com/letstalkaboutdune/AbsoluteUnitsXL) unitset.

Mainly intended for people who want to use fully transparent unit icons, and don't want to keep guessing what embarked units actually are.

## To use: 
1. Download, then enable AbsoluteUnitsXL as a permanent audiovisual mod
2. Select AbsoluteUnits under Options > Display > Unitset

## Screenshots:
See [AbsoluteUnits](https://github.com/letstalkaboutdune/AbsoluteUnits), but imagine bigger people. =)
